As we said earlier, this is a long manual, packed with details, and you are dedicated indeed if you have read every word to get here.

Awk, like any language, is best learned by experience and practice, so we encourage you to write your own programs. They don’t have to be big or complicated — you can usually learn how some feature works or test some crucial point with only a couple of lines of code, and you can just type in data to see how the program behaves.
